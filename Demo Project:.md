Demo Project:
Complete CI/CD with Terraform

Technologies used:
Terraform, Jenkins, Docker, AWS, Git, Java, Maven, Linux, Docker Hub

Project Description:
Integrate provisioning stage into complete CI/CD Pipeline to automate provisioning server instead of deploying to an existing server
• Create SSHKey Pair
• Install Terraform inside Jenkins container
• Add Terraform configuration to application's git repository
• Adjust Jenkinsfile to add "provision" step to the CI/CD pipeline that provisions EC2 instance
• So the complete CI/CD project we build has the following configuration:
a. Cl step: Build artifact for Java Maven application
b. Cl step: Build and push Docker image to Docker Hub
c. CD step: Automatically provision EC2 instance using TF
d. CD step: Deploy new application version on the provisioned EC2 instance with Docker Compose
Module 12: Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
